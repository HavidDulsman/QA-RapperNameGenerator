## Brief
As quoted from 'QAC - Practical Project Specification (DevOps):

    " At itscore you are creating an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of 
    predefined rules.  These “Objects” can be from whatever domain you wish. "
### Requirements
Some of the requirements for a 'Minimal Viable Product' included:
 + Create a micro-service orientated architecture for a application:
    * Service 1: Used to render Jinja2 templates for interaction, connect to the other services, and finally persisting 
          some data into a SQL Database
    * Service 2/3: Used to generate 'Objects'
    * Service 4: Used to create an 'Object' based of the results of Services 2 and 3 using interesting logic
 + 2 Different implementations between Services 2, 3 and 4
 + Deployment using containerisation and a orchestration tool
 + Advanced CI practices using Jenkins and Ansible
 + Refined skills of services and tools used in the previous project

## Project Plan
### Kanban Board
Once again, my project will utilise a kanban board to affectly produce a task backlog based of the User Stories and the requirements for a Minimal Viable Product. The lay out stay the same, moving from left to right.

The Project will also make use of the MoSCoW Prioritisation method to categorise the importance of tasks and features.

## Architecture
For those have a cheeky look at my repo early, nothing here yet! Will it be big? Maybe. Maybe not.

## Risk Assessment
A risk assessment was compiled to look and examine risk related to the project, its requirements and demands. Due to the complexity and detail of my risk assessment, i have opted to include it as it own file which can be accessed through the repository or by using this link.
